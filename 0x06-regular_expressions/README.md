# Regular expression

In this project, I learned how to use regular expressions. All my regex is built for the Oniguruma library.

## Tasks.

_Note: Each Ruby script in the project matches regular expressions based on an argument passed to it via the command line._

* **0. Simply matching School**
  * Ruby script that matches the regular expression `School`.

* **1. Repetition Token #0**
  * Ruby script that matches the regular expression `hbn` with between 2-5 `t`'s in between `hb` and `n`.

* **2. Repetition Token #1**
  * Ruby script that matches the regular expression `hn` with 0 or 1 occurrences of `b` and 0 or 1
    occurrences of `t` in between `h` and `n`.

* **3. Repetition Token #2**
  * Ruby script that matches the regular expression `hbn` with 1 or more `t`'s in between `hb` and `n`.

* **4. Repetition Token #3**
  * Ruby script that matches the regular expression `hbn` with 0 or more `t`'s in between `hb` and `n`.

* **5. Not quite HBTN yet**
  * Ruby script that matches a regular expression starting with `h` and ending with `n` with any single character in between.

* **6. Call me maybe**
  * Ruby script that matches a regular expression representing a 10-digit phone number.
