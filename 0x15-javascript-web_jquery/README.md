This project involves creating various JavaScript scripts to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) in a web browser. The scripts use vanilla JavaScript as well as the jQuery library to perform tasks such as updating text content, changing styles, handling user interactions, making API requests, and dynamically modifying HTML elements. The project covers a range of functionalities, from basic DOM manipulation to more advanced features like toggling classes, adding/removing list items, and fetching data from external APIs.

Here's a brief overview of the main functionalities implemented in each script:

No JQuery (0-script.js):

Updates the text color of the <header> element to red using document.querySelector.
With JQuery (1-script.js):

Updates the text color of the <header> element to red using jQuery.
Click and turn red (2-script.js):

Changes the text color of the <header> element to red when the user clicks on the DIV#red_header.
Add .red class (3-script.js):

Adds the class red to the <header> element when the user clicks on the DIV#red_header.
Toggle classes (4-script.js):

Toggles the class of the <header> element between red and green when the user clicks on the DIV#toggle_header.
List of elements (5-script.js):

Adds a new <li> element to the <ul> with the class my_list when the user clicks on the DIV#add_item.
Change the text (6-script.js):

Updates the text of the <header> element to "New Header!!!" when the user clicks on the DIV#update_header.
Star Wars character (7-script.js):

Fetches the character name from the Star Wars API and displays it in the <div> with the id character.
Star Wars movies (8-script.js):

Fetches and lists the titles of Star Wars movies from the API, appending them to the <ul> with the id list_movies.
Say Hello! (9-script.js):

Fetches a translation of "Hello" from an API and displays it in the <div> with the id hello.
No jQuery - document loaded (100-script.js):

Updates the text color of the <header> element to red using document.querySelector without relying on jQuery.
List, add, remove (101-script.js):

Adds, removes, and clears <li> elements from a list when the user clicks on specified buttons.
Say hello to everybody! (102-script.js):

Fetches and displays translations of "Hello" in different languages based on user input using an API.
And press ENTER (103-script.js):

Extends the functionality of the previous script to trigger translation when the user presses the ENTER key.
This project showcases the versatility of JavaScript and jQuery in creating interactive and dynamic web pages, with a focus on DOM manipulation, event handling, and API requests.
